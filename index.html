			<p>The image to the right shows the area of North Leitrim where I grew up.
				<br>I walked this hill most mornings and evenings as a teenager checking on the cattle for my father.
				<br>There is no way to describe the feeling I enjoyed of being on a windswept hill in stormy weather,
				feeling that connection to nature and the land of my forefathers.
				<br>
				<br>I hope to raise awareness of Leitrim and all it has to offer to as wide an audience as possible,
				it is no coincidence the people from Britain, Germany, Spain, France, Slovakia, Lithuania, Poland and
				beyond choose to live here.

			<p><img class="float-left" src="assets/images/LoughGill.jpg" alt="A view of Lough Gill, County Leitrim">From
				Lough Gill (left), Lough Melvin and the beautiful glaciated valleys of Glenade and Glencar
				<em>(including of course Glencar Waterfall)</em>,
				<br> in the north of the county,
				<br>to the Shannon-Erne Waterway which runs from Leitrim Village via
				Ballinamore further south, there are no shortage of rivers and lakes, wooded areas and mountains,
				dramatic waterfalls, and empty space to explore.
				<br>
				<br>There are historic sites such as Parkes'Castle on the shores of Lough Gill, Creevelea Friary near
				Dromahair, Hamilton's Castle
				in Manorhamilton, Sean Mac Dhiarmada's cottage between Glenfarne and Kiltyclogher, most towns and
				villages have places of note to visit.
				<br>
				<br>
				There is abundant wildlife with plenty for birdwatchers and wildlife enthusiasts to enjoy, around my
				home I see Goldfinches, Bluetits,
				Great tits, Robins, Sparrows, Swans, Kingfishers, Cranes, as well as Rooks, Ravens and Crows. In
				addition to birds there are Badgers,
				Foxes, Hares, Minks and Red Deer in my locality, Red Squirells are rare but can be found

				including some of the nationalities
				listed above. There are boat hire companies and tours on the River Shannon. Carrick-on-Shannon is on the
				N4 roadway which connects Sligo

			<h3>Water Disruption in Carrick on Shannon</h3>
			<p>There have been ongoing issues with water supply in the Attinfinlay area of Carrick on Shannon in recent
				months,
				a water main burst it's pipes near Aura leisure complex and efforts to repair it have taken longer than
				originally anticipated.
				A source from Irish Water confirms that engineers suspect a small leak caused loose sand in it's area to
				act like sandpaper as it
				swirled in the water, effectively wearing away at the pipe's seal thus causing the larger leak which
				resulted in streams of water
				running down the street yesterday.
				<br>
				There are disruptions to supply the morning of Thursday 13th July 2023 as a result, it is hoped supply
				can be restored by the afternoon.
			</p>

			<h3>Money raised for Alzheimers Research</h3>
			<p>A big thank you to all who participated in the table quiz in Gurn's Milestone Lounge, Manorhamilton last
				Thursday,
				6th July 2023. The money raised goes to Alzheimers research,
				a total of €800 was raised on the night. The presentation about Alzheimers Research from Eimear
				Shannon-Kelly was informative and went down well with the attendees.
				<br>
				Further events are planned in the near future so keep watching!
			</p>

			<h3>Concern over Increase in Burglaries</h3>
			<p>At the most recent Community Forum sitting Inspector Gadget confirmed
				there has been an increase in reported burglaries for County Leitrim
				this year so far. Locals are advised to be cautious amd to take the following steps:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Ensure doors and windows are secured if you are leaving home</li>
				<li>If you are holidaying please don't advertise your absence on social media</li>
				<li>If you have an alarm ensure is is working properly and set it whenever you leave the house and at
					night</li>
				<li>Those of you with dogs will know a good loud bark can scare off wrondoers</li>
				<li>Report any suspicious vehicles or people calling to houses to local Gardaí</li>
			</ol>

			<p>A number of people spoke at the event:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A Drumkeeran local expressed concern at the number of retiring Gardaí who are not being replaced in
					rural areas.</li>
				<li>A Dromahair man queried the usefulness of using UV paint to mark equipment in case of theft.</li>
				<li>A woman from Tarmon spoke of concerns about speeding motorists on the Drumshanbo to Drumkeeran road
					which passes through her locality, seeking speed checkpoints on local routes as well
					as national roads.</li>
				<li>A Carrick on Shannon resident spoke about anti-social behaviour in a local playground after hours,
					saying it is a haunt for wayward teens and drunken people on their way home from
					nights out, residences facing onto the playground are subject to loud music, shouting and occupants
					receive aggressive responses when asking the people to move off.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Shortage of Pre-School and Creche Places In Leitrim</h3>
			<p>A number of frustrated parents have expressed their difficulty in obtaining pre-school and creche places
				for
				their children in County Leitrim, many services contacted admit that staff shortages and high booking
				levels
				have contributed to an 18 to 24 month waiting list being necessary. Single income families in particular
				are struggling to find sufficient childcare to enable a second parent to return to work. This is, of
				course,
				exacerbated by the onhoing cost-of-living crisis. Representations to local politicians have so far
				failed to achieve any satisfactory response.</p>

			<h3>Annual Angling Tournament in Dromahair</h3>
			<p>The annual angling tournament in Dromahair will take place this year on the August bank holiday weekend,
				running Friday to Sunday. Registration is now open for those wishing to compete, entry forms are
				available.
				Following the cheating controversy of last year certain individuals who will remain unnamed, PHILIP, are
				unwelcome at this years event. There are no anticipated protests that we are aware of though in light of
				that last line Mr. Meehan may show up.
				<br>
				Closing date for entries is 24th July 2023, get your entry form submitted!
			</p>

			<h3>Tractor Run in Drumshanbo</h3>
			<p>This year's Tractor Run in Drumshanbo will take place at Halloween, 31st October 2023.
				The theme, obviously, will be all things scary so get your imaginations going and decorate those
				tractors.
				There will be food and drinks available before and after the run in the community centre. Entry is €10
				and
				sponsorship cards are available on request, money raised will go towards the fund for repairing the roof
				of the parish church.
				<br>
				Since Mohill went all out last year we have to step up and make a mark this year, don't let the side
				down.
			</p>

			<h3>Progressive 25 Card Game in Killenumery Community Centre</h3>
			<p>The weekly session of Progressive 25 staged in Killenumery Community Centre has been postpomed in recent
				weeks
				due to a leak in the roof, the local caretaker has informed us that repairs have been carried out and
				the weekly
				game can resume from next Tuesday evening at 7pm. Those wishing to attend will be relieved to know that
				the heating
				problem has also been resolved and warm jackets will no longer be a necessity. Fr. Whatsit admits he is
				looking
				forward to getting the game back up and running, he was on a winning streak before the roof leak, he has
				promised
				chocolate biscuits with the tea at next week's game.</p>

			<h3>Swimming Lessons in Aura Swimming Pool</h3>
			<p>A Garda qualified in water safety, and living locally, has volunteered to give swimming lessons to
				beginners
				at Aura Leisure Complex, Carrick on Shannon, beginning Saturday 5th August at 10am. There are no age
				limits and
				all are welcome, should there be sufficient interest additional classes may be arranged. Interested
				persons are
				asked to contact staff at Aura for registration.</p>

			<h3>Mohill Tractor Run</h3>
			<p>Mohill Community Group have announced that the theme for this year's tractor run will be Pirates, as with
				last year all efforts are to be made to show up Drumshanbo's effort. A source who wished to remain
				anonymous
				said "Your one in that committe is touched, whatever her problem with Drumshanbo is the rest of us
				aren't as
				bothered, my mother was from Drumshanbo". Some of last years participants have indicated they may join
				the
				Drumshanbo tractor run instead. In fairness the money raised will go to Women's Aid, a worthy cause.
				Mohill
				GAA have indicated that despite internal conflict they will support the effort.</p>

			<h3>1995 U-16 County Final rematch</h3>
			<p>There have been expressions of interest in staging a rematch between the Dromahair and Gortletteragh
				teams
				who contested the U-16 county final in 1995. The match was unique in that the Dromahair side had only 13
				players
				available and Gortletteragh agreed to play 13-a-side in a spirit of goodwill. Gortletteragh won the
				original match,
				having also beaten Dromahair in the U-14 final a year previously, with many of the same players taking
				part in both
				games. The players are now in their mid 40's and admit they are not in the same condition as back then.
				Some Dromahair
				backs have expressed the desire to resume old rivalries with Gortletteragh's forwards, feeling there is
				unfinished business.
				The match is due to take place, all things going well, in March of next year, a venue has yet to be
				decided.
