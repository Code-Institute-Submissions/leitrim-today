			<p>Welcome to Leitrim Today, where users registered on this site can post updates of news and events from around the county. 
			<br>The information contained here will allow visitors and holiday makers to discover local points of interest as they visit County Leitrim.
			<br>I grew up in a rural area near Dromahair in North County Leitrim and I have always had a love for my home county, the image to the right shows the view from the hill behind my family home.
			<br>I walked this hill most mornings and evenings as a teenager checking on the cattle for my father. 
			There is no way to describe the feeling of being on a windswept hill in wind swept or stormy weather feeling that connection to nature.
			I have spent far too many years away from my home, my family and friends, and hope to reconnect in the coming years.
