			<p>The image to the right shows the area of North Leitrim where I grew up.
			<br>I walked this hill most mornings and evenings as a teenager checking on the cattle for my father. 
			There is no way to describe the feeling I enjoyed of being on a windswept hill in stormy weather, 
			feeling that connection to nature and the land of my forefathers.
			<br>
			<br>I hope to raise awareness of Leitrim and all it has to offer to as wide an audience as possible, 
			it is no coincidence the people from Britain, Germany, Spain, France, Slovakia, Lithuania, Poland and beyond choose to live here.

			<p>From Lough Gill (left), Lough Melvin and the beautiful glaciated valleys of Glenade and Glencar <em>(including of course Glencar Waterfall)</em>,  
			Fivemilebourne also deserves a mention, in the north of the county, to the Shannon-Erne Waterway which runs from Leitrim Village via 
			Ballinamore further south, there are no shortage of rivers and lakes, wooded areas and mountains, dramatic waterfalls, and empty space. 
			<br>
			<br>There are historic sites such as Parkes'Castle on the shores of Lough Gill, Creevelea Friary near Dromahair, Hamilton's Castle 
			in Manorhamilton, Sean Mac Dhiarmada's cottage between Glenfarne and Kiltyclogher, most towns and villages have places of note to visit.

			<p>Carrick-on-Shannon is the county town, the largest in County Leitrim by a good margin and yet the smallest such in Ireland. Carrick is 
			popular with stag and hen nights, weddings and weekend life and it is populated by over 4,000 people including some of the nationalities 
			listed above. There are boat hire companies and tours on the River Shannon. Carrick-on-Shannon is on the N4 roadway which connects Sligo 
			to Dublin and there are regular bus and train connections.</p>

				<h3>Water Disruption in Carrick on Shannon</h3>
				<p>There have been ongoing issues with water supply in the Attinfinlay area of Carrick on Shannon in recent months, 
				  a water main burst it's pipes near Aura leisure complex and efforts to repair it have taken longer than originally anticipated. 
				A source from Irish Water confirms that engineers suspect a small leak caused loose sand in it's area to act like sandpaper as it 
				swirled in the water, effectively wearing away at the pipe's seal thus causing the larger leak which resulted in streams of water 
				running down the street.
				<br>
				There are disruptions to supply the morning of Thursday 13th July 2023 as a result, it is hoped supply can be restored by the afternoon.</p>
			
				<h3>Money raised for Alzheimers Research</h3>
				<p>A big thank you to all who participated in the table quiz in Gurn's Milestone Lounge, Manorhamilton last Thursday, 
					6th July 2023. The money raised goes to Alzheimers research, 
					a total of €800 was raised on the night. The presentation about Alzheimers Research from Eimear 
					Shannon-Kelly was informative and went down well with the attendees. 
				<br>
				Further events are planned in the near future so keep watching!</p>
				
				<h3>Concern over Increase in Burglaries</h3>
				<p>At the most recent Community Forum sitting Inspector Gadget confirmed
					 there has been an increase in reported burglaries for County Leitrim 
					 this year so far. Locals are advised to be cautious amd to take the following steps:</p>
					 <ol>
						<li>Ensure doors and windows are secured if you are leaving home</li>
						<li>If you are holidaying please don't advertise your absence on social media</li>
						<li>If you have an alarm ensure is is working properly and set it whenever you leave the house and at night</li>
						<li>Those of you with dogs will know a good loud bark can scare off wrondoers</li>
						<li>Report any suspicious vehicles or people calling to houses to local Gardaí</li>
					 </ol> 
				
				<p>A number of people spoke at the event, Drumkeeran local Kevin Harkin expressed concern at the number of 
				retiring Gardaí who are not being replaced in rural areas. Dromahair man Jim Kelly queried the usefulness of using 
				UV paint to mark equipment in case of theft. John Flynn of Tarmon spoke of concerns about speeding motorists on the 
				Drumshanbo to Drumkeeran road which passes through his locality, seeking speed checkpoints on local routes as well 
				as national roads.</p>
