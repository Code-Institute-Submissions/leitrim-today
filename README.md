Welcome to Project 1,

This is my idea for a website, to create a local news and events forum that registered users can upload information to, specific to my home county of Leitrim, Ireland.

To start with I have created a basic index.html file which will serve as the home page of the website, I intend to add a news file, an events file and a registration file. The code I intend to use in constructing the website will be based on the lessons learned in the 5 Day Coding Challenge and Code Institute LMS.

The county colours of Leitrim are Green and Gold, I intend to implement these colours in the website to resonate with local users. I experimented with varying font types before selecting Palatino Linotype. I intend to upload images of locations in Leitrim which I have taken myself, most are low resolution taken with mobile phones so if not suitable for larger screens I will try to rescale so quality is not sacrificed. 

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
