    <h2>Water Disruption in Carrick on Shannon</h2>
    <p>There have been ongoing issues with water supply in the Attinfinlay area of Carrick on Shannon in recent months, 
      a water main burst it's pipes near Aura leisure complex and efforts to repair it have taken longer than originally anticipated. 
    A source from Irish Water confirms that engineers suspect a small leak caused loose sand in it's area to act like sandpaper as it 
    swirled in the water, effectively wearing away at the pipe's seal thus causing the larger leak which resulted in streams of water 
    running down the street.
    <br>
    There are disruptions to supply the morning of Thursday 13th July 2023 as a result, it is hoped supply can be restored by the afternoon.</p>
